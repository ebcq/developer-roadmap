# Understand the OSI model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a network system. It divides network communication into seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. Each layer performs specific tasks and interacts with the layers directly above and below it, providing a structured approach to designing, implementing, and troubleshooting network protocols and services.
