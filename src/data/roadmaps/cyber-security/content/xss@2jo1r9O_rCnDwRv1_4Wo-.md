# XSS

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that affects web applications, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can then be executed by the browsers of unsuspecting users who visit the compromised web page. The danger of XSS lies in its ability to access cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive information that the user's browser handles, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user.
