# Understand the basics and general flow of deploying in the cloud

Cloud deployment refers to the process of setting up and delivering applications, services, or infrastructure through cloud computing platforms. It involves choosing a deployment model—public, private, or hybrid—and configuring the necessary resources to host and manage these services in the cloud. Cloud deployment allows organizations to leverage cloud providers' infrastructure, scale resources as needed, and access services over the internet, reducing the need for on-premises hardware and maintenance.
