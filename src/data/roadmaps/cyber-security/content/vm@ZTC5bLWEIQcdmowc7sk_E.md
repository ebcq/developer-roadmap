# VM

A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer, created within a host system using virtualization technology. It runs its own operating system and applications as if it were a separate physical machine, but shares the host system's resources like CPU, memory, and storage. VMs are used for various purposes, including testing and development, running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine, and improving system efficiency and isolation.
