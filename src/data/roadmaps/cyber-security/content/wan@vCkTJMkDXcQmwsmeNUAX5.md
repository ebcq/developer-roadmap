# WAN

A **Wide Area Network (WAN)** is a telecommunication network that extends over a large geographical area, such as interconnecting multiple local area networks (LANs). WANs commonly use leased lines, circuit switching, or packet switching to transmit data between LANs, allowing them to share resources and communicate with one another. A WAN can be privately owned and managed, or leased from telecommunication service providers.
