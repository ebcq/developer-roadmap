# Understand the Definition of Risk

In cybersecurity, risk refers to the potential for harm or loss due to vulnerabilities in a system or network that could be exploited by threats. It involves evaluating the likelihood of a security breach or attack occurring and the potential impact on an organization's data, systems, and operations. Managing cybersecurity risk involves identifying threats and vulnerabilities, assessing their potential impact, and implementing controls to mitigate or reduce the risk to acceptable levels.
