Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a network security standard designed to make it easier to connect devices to a secure wireless network. It allows users to add devices to a Wi-Fi network using a simple setup process, typically involving pressing a WPS button on the router and the device or entering a PIN. While WPS simplifies the connection process, it has known security vulnerabilities, which can potentially be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the network.
