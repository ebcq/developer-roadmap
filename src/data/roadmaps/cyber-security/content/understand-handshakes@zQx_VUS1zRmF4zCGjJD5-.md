# Understand Handshakes

In cybersecurity, a handshake refers to the process of establishing a secure communication channel between two parties, such as a client and a server. During the handshake, the parties exchange information to agree on encryption protocols, authentication methods, and other settings necessary for a secure connection. This process is crucial for setting up secure sessions in various protocols, including HTTPS and VPNs, ensuring that data transmitted between the parties is protected from eavesdropping and tampering.
