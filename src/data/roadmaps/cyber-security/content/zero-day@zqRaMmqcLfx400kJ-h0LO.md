# Zero Day

A **zero-day** refers to a vulnerability in software, hardware, or firmware that is unknown to the parties responsible for fixing or patching it. Cybercriminals can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to systems, steal sensitive data, or perform other malicious activities. Zero-day vulnerabilities are particularly dangerous because they are difficult to detect and prevent, given that there are no existing fixes or defenses against them.
